SWAPI-Box was built using the SWAPI-API. Multiple fetch calls were made using async/await. The project includes a card-section and three different card components. Users access the cards by clicking on one of three buttons, people, planets, and vehicles. Users can favorite cards and access them by clicking the favorites button.
